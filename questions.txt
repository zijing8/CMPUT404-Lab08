    Token authentication genarates a token for access, have to use token when you want to login, this is statless. Session authentication starts a 
session when you login, the server keeps track of session ID, and you don't need to send a token with request, gets stored on
broswer as a cookie, it is also statful.

Question 4: Provide a high level summary of what happens during an OAuth2 authentication flow. For instance: bitbucket.org > Log In > Log in with Google. What happens when I click "Log in with Google"?
    When you use something like "LOGIN WITH GOOGLE", Authenticate one service using another service. 
bitbucket.org --> Login with Google --> Takes you to Google page --> Enter username and password --> Google shared an authentication Token with bitbucket.org
--> bitbucket.org use authentication token and login
